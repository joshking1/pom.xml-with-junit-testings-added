# pom.xml-with-junit-testings-added

# Install Maven (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get install maven

# Run Maven build and test commands
mvn clean install
mvn test


These commands install Maven (if not already installed) and then execute the Maven build and test commands for your project.


Save the Jenkins job configuration.
Regarding the dependencies required on the Jenkins server, you need to ensure that Maven is installed. The above Jenkins script assumes that Maven is already installed on the Jenkins server.


Additionally, JUnit dependencies are managed through your project's pom.xml file, so make sure you have added the necessary JUnit dependencies in your project's pom.xml file, as shown in the previous answer.


After configuring the Jenkins script and ensuring the required dependencies are in place, Jenkins will execute the Maven build and test commands, including JUnit tests, as part of your job's build process
